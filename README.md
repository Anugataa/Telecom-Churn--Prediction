# Telecom-Churn--Prediction
The customers of "Telecom Industry" are free to select from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. The industry is highly competitive and faces around 15-25% of churning per year in average. Retaining existing customers is much more important than acquiring new customers as it costs around 5-10 times more to acquire one new customer. So, retaining high profitable customers is the first priority for telecom operators.
